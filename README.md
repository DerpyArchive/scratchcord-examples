# scratchcord-examples
Example projects to make with ScratchCord.

The only official example at the moment is a "Guess The Number" style game that posts scores to a Discord Channel. The idea is based off PassTheMayo's bot of the same name, which you can view it's repository here: https://github.com/JacobGunther12/Guess-That-Number


More examples will come soon, and if you wish to contribute some please tell me on the ScratchCord server here: https://discord.gg/tJMKV4e
