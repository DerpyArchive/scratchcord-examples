Example opensource projects to show what you can make with ScratchCord.

**Examples**:

A ScratchCord "Guess The Number" style game that posts scores to a Discord Channel. The idea is based off PassTheMayo's bot of the same name, which you can view it's repository here: https://github.com/PassTheMayo/Guess-That-Number

A ScratchCord Spotify player, which logs the songs that are played into a channel.

A ScratchCord Weather Search thing, that will log requests to a channel.

Thank you for reading.
